# solar-characterization
Everything related to the characterization of solar cells/panels

The IV_Swinger_2 is a PCB and application that will automatically generate IV-curves for solar panels. We are using it to characterize the performance of the solar panels on the satellite.

Use IV_Swinger2_SSR_mod_PCB_Step_by_Step_v1.01.pdf for assembly instructions. The only changes are that R1 should be a 7.5kOhm resistor, and the SHUNT resistor should be 1 Ohm. 

One IV Swinger is already assembled and awaiting testing, another is in the process of assembly.
